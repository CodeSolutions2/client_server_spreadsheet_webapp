# client_server_spreadsheet_webapp

This is a JavaScript/Google Apps Script and HTML framework for how to create a Server-side and Client-side web application. The Server-side is integrated to the google spreadsheet using google apps scripts commands, thus spreadsheet variables can be transferred to and from the deployed browser webapp. However, a client-side user may not be familiar with deploying google apps scripts to load spreadsheet variables to the browser supported web interface. Thus, at a basic level the client-side spreadsheet, for user distribution, launches a pop-up to the server webapp and a spreadsheet-like interface is available for the user to use with their client-side spreadsheet. A tensorflow.js model structure can be included in the code, if the client requests.

In summary, the Client google apps script file should launch the UI widow to the server, and the Server google apps script file should contain a spreadsheet/dynamic table written in JavaScript. The user/client can copy-paste information from their client-side spreadsheet, into the server spreadsheet (ie: the server spreadsheet could be programmed to run a model API that transforms user data); the user/client can then copy-paste their transformed information back to their client-side spreadsheet.
